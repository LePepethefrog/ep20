When it comes to monster skills all come from my observation and understanding of the skills used on kro footage, i watched over 40 hours of kro footage to get a good look at the skills being used... HOWEVER the monsters dont like casting skills they could be hitting someone for over 30 seconds and cast nothing, on top of that players that post their gameplay oneshot the monsters without any effort (on top of ~40% of the monsters being passive due to lore reasons). Wandering Star was nice enough to let the instance boss hit him with his full rotation, however the only footage i found of the field MVPs is from Gunny and she 3 shot them when the monsters barely had casted 2 skills each, so some speculative skills were added to field bosses
